# Task and PR Size Guidance

Use this reference when `ready` decides whether a request should become one
TaskDocument, several TaskDocuments, or a workflow. The numbers are heuristics
for reviewability, not schema or command behavior.

Checked: 2026-05-22

## Primary Rule

One task or PR should make one self-contained, reviewable change with its own
acceptance checks. Prefer small slices, but do not split so far that the change
stops making sense in isolation.

## Size Heuristic

- `small`: 1-5 meaningful files, <= 200 meaningful changed lines.
- `medium`: 6-10 meaningful files, <= 400 meaningful changed lines.
- `large-justified`: more than 10 meaningful files, more than 5 source modules,
  or more than 400 meaningful changed lines. Split first; keep as one only with
  an explicit coupling reason and review/check plan.
- `usually too large`: 20+ meaningful files for ordinary feature/refactor work,
  or around 50 files for non-mechanical review work.

Count generated files, lockfiles, snapshots, mass deletes, and mechanical
renames separately from meaningful review files. A broad mechanical change can
be reviewable when the reviewer is validating the transformation, not reasoning
through each changed site independently.

## Split Triggers

Split or justify when a slice:

- mixes multiple concepts, such as model/schema, CLI contract, persistence,
  runtime behavior, docs/help, and tests/fixtures;
- touches more than one subsystem without a single coupling reason;
- needs multiple reviewers with unrelated ownership areas;
- lacks a clear review order through the changed files;
- would take more than about 60 minutes for a careful reviewer to inspect;
- has no acceptance check beyond "looks good".

## Acceptable Large Cases

Keep a larger slice together when splitting would be worse:

- one atomic migration boundary;
- trusted mechanical refactor or rename;
- generated output required by one source change;
- deletion-heavy cleanup;
- API plus one representative usage and tests where separating them would hide
  the API's implications;
- compatibility shims that must land with the behavior they preserve.

For these, write `large-justified` in the planning section and include:

- why the files move together;
- which files or modules are the review starting points;
- which files are generated or mechanical;
- focused checks that reduce review risk.
